I developed a tool to automate the quality assurance process for HP's Content team. Using Pandas and data from the SCS report in the HP product content database, the tool cleans and compares information gathered by the team, returning a set of new columns with valuable insights for QA purposes.

By automating this process, I have significantly reduced the amount of time and effort required for manual QA, allowing the team to focus on more strategic initiatives. The beta testing of this tool is currently ongoing, and I am excited to continue refining and improving its capabilities.
